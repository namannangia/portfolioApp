1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/namannangia/portfolioApp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

## Customization

You can easily customize the website to match your personal brand and preferences.

### Updating Content

1. Open the `src/data` directory to find JSON files that store your content, such as `projects.json`. Update these files with your own project information, skills, and other details.

2. Replace the default images in the `src/assets/images` directory with your project images.

### Styling

To customize the website's styling, you can modify the CSS by editing the styles in the `src/assets/css` directory. You can also use a CSS preprocessor like SCSS if you prefer.

### Adding Additional Sections

To add more sections to your portfolio website, create React components in the `src/components` directory and import them in the `src/App.js` file. Then, update the navigation links in the header.

## Deployment

Once you've customized your portfolio website and you're satisfied with the content and design, you can deploy it to a web hosting service of your choice. Popular options include Netlify, Vercel, and GitHub Pages. Refer to the documentation of your chosen hosting platform for deployment instructions.
